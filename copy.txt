Hello, r/forhire/!

We are WEB CHEMISTS - a team of two web designers from Bucharest, Romania, who solve visual puzzles - and we'd love to cook some goodies for you! At a fair price!
Basically, we'd like to work with small/medium businesses or individuals who need to pump up the graphics of their online presence.

Here's what we do:

- We build websites from scratch, from design concept to cross-browser HTML/CSS
- We make responsive websites and websites responsive - we love to do UI/UX for mobile platforms
- We make cool modifications on existing websites. We design for emotion!
- We customise WordPress templates just like you want it - nobody's gonna know it's a purchased template after we're done.

Here's we we won't do:

- Build large websites that involve advanced back-end skills. We know what a database and a query are, but we won't develop the next Facebook.
- Anything that is NOT related to website design/HTML/CSS/JavaScript (we mostly use jQuery for our projects).

PM me for quotes! We are reasonable guys who work with their heart first! Oh, and here's some of our best works: http://webchemists.dunked.com/



So, are we gonna fire up a batch or what?
